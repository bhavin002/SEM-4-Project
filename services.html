                        as they
                        arise—issues that can slow network response, cause downtime, or indicate a serious security
                        breach. But cybersecurity experts must then be at hand to promptly and individually analyze the
                        sheer volume of alerts received. They’ll also need to correlate incidents and determine which of
                        those might indicate a threat that’s malicious, significant, or part of a much larger and more
                        serious attack.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Managed Detection and Response, or MDR, is a layered
                        security approach that pairs robust technology with a human element to address the continual
                        barrage of cybersecurity threats, interpret those events, and respond accordingly. MDR providers
                        bring the expertise needed to understand the full context of each incident, providing pertinent
                        recommendations on modifications that organizations can implement to notably enhance security
                        and mitigate future attacks. Not only is this good business practice but it also helps
                        businesses stay in compliance with regulations like PCI, SOX, GLBA, HIPAA, FACTA, NIST 800-53,
                        and FERPA.While larger organizations have built Managed Detection and Response into their
                        overall security
                        strategy and framework, small- to mid-sized organizations, though equally vulnerable to
                        cyberattack, typically lack the resources to ensure around-the-clock attention. Recruitment and
                        onboarding of professionals with an advanced security skillset along with the ongoing training
                        and education that goes along with can also prove costly.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="font-size: 18px;">A virtual chief information security officer, or vCISO, is
                        a professional who works routinely with organizations to provide all of the essential cyber
                        security support one would expect from an in-house senior executive within a more efficient and
                        affordable service model. Gain day-to-day cyber security support and counsel from a dedicated
                        vCISO along with long-term security strategy, vision, program and policy design, and
                        implementation.
                        vCISOs conduct a comprehensive assessment of a company’s security posture to pinpoint weaknesses
                        and optimize their security standing over the long-term. Acting either as a long-standing
                        resource for your team or as interim CISO, a vCISO will step in to establish security standards,
                        implement controls, and respond rapidly to incidents—continually refining your approach to
                        address the dynamic threat landscape along with industry best practices and regulations.</p>

                    <p class="lead">The art of exploiting weaknesses and vulnerabilities in networks, web applications,
                        or people. This is different than just performing a vulnerability scan against your network. A
                        penetration test takes the perspective of an outside intruder or an internal individual with
                        malicious intent. This may not always involve technology, however technical controls are a big
                        part of preventing easy exploitation and data compromise.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="font-size: 18px;">Every business faces its own set of challenges, from
                        rules and regulations to highly sophisticated data security threats. And regardless of
                        company size, one-on-one counsel from a dedicated cyber security engineer is often essential
                        to keep pace. Still short of hiring a CISO or multiple security experts, it can be
                        challenging to pinpoint hidden vulnerabilities, draft the right action plan, or choose the
                        best technologies for your environment to safeguard data assets and comply with new
                        laws—particularly within our fast-paced and ever-adapting threat landscape.
                        But with our Cyber Security Consulting, we offer a no-compromise solution that eliminates
                        new hire commitments while delivering the executive-level counsel needed to succeed. Gain a

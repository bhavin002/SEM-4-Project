                        offices or service the medical industry, we have a program that can be tailored for your

                        on many platforms across many campuses. We help design controls for applications.</h2>
                    <p class="lead" style="font-size: 18px;">Higher Education had 7.6 Million records breached in 2017
                        alone. While the number seems
                        significant at first glance, the number of data breaches have been going down in Higher Ed over
                        the last few years. This is in part due to the adoption of new cyber security controls by
                        colleges and universities. Our team is a proud contributor to the NIST Cyber Security Framework.
                        We work with colleges and universities throughout the United States to meet cyber security
                        challenges. As control requirements increase for FERPA, FACTA, PCI and HIPAA, we are here to
                        help you meet those requirements. No challenge is too big or too small to engage us for
                        assistance. We want to be your long term cyber security partner.

                        challenge for some of the
                        largest financial institutions. Credit Unions and Community Banks are also feeling the same
                        pressure.</h2>
                    <p class="lead" style="font-size: 18px;">Banks and Credit Unions are one of the most regulated
                        industry in the United States. This makes it a challenge to meet all the compliance requirements
                        in order to conduct business. Cyber Security Services offers solutions for Banks and Credit
                        Unions that need to maintain compliance with GLBA, BSA, FACTA, SOX, and PCI. We assist with
                        industry recognized standards such as the FFIEC guidelines. Our team is comprised of former
                        Chief Information Security Officers and Privacy Officers in the banking industry. We know how to
                        meet the requirements of outside regulating bodies as well as your customers. We have the

                    <p class="lead" style="font-size: 18px;">Application Service Providers are under a lot of pressure
                        to meet the cyber security requirements of their customers. As a service provider, it is not
                        enough to meet general industry standards. You are often having to meet the many standards and
                        regulations that your customers are obligated to achieve. We help meet the standards by
                        providing services tailored to the SaaS industry. This includes everything that a customer may
                        ask for as part of their due diligence process.</p>
